TODO:
-----
- properly implement remaining lifecycle methods:
  - handleInit has to be called on first activation
  - ...
- implement handling of view events in annotations extensions
- properly handle debug in browser (process.env should be the excpetion)
- rules option needs to be handled by datalayer.initialize
- datalayer should have no issues with being (re-)initialized as often as necessary (update tests after that)
- `data-datalayer-config` needs to be available to support extensions together with methodQueue-style import
- reimplement meta-based configuration (maybe as extension?)
- add timestamp to events in `Datalayer.addPlugin` so plugins can decide to ignore old events
- create "attribution" extension based on attribution.js library
- (use github issues for TODO handling ;) ..
- ...

IDEAS:
------
- create "monitoring" extension that measures execution times of datalayer and plugins
- ...
