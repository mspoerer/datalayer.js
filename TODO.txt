TODO:
-----
- properly implement remaining lifecycle methods:
  - handleInit should be called on first activation
  - ...
- implement handling of view events in annotations extensions
- rules option needs to be handled by datalayer.initialize
- datalayer should have no issues with being (re-)initialized as often as necessary (update tests after that)
- reimplement meta-based config (maybe as extension?)
- `data-datalayer-config` needs to be available to support extensions together with methodQueue-style import
- add timestamp to events in `Datalayer.addPlugin` so plugins can decide to ignore old events
- ...
