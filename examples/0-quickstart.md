# Quickstart Tutorial

(THIS DOCUMENT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!)

This is a 10-minute, quickstart, FAQ-style tutorial to get you up and running with info and guideance about datalayer.js. It offers some theoretical and historical information first and then concentrates on the technical details. 

## 1. Background Info

### What is a datalayer and why do I need it?
> Feel free to skip this question, if you worked with tagmanagers or datalayers before. Most of this is meant to give an understanding of why developers should have a major interest in using a datalayer versus the "classical", sourcecode-level integration of 3rd party scripts.
... 

### What is special about datalayer.js?
Datalayer.js is designed specifically for developers while minimizing business risks at the same time:

- improves the time-to-market of tracking and third party integration
- reduces the chance of business threats caused by 3rd-party-related performance impacts or production errors
- greatly simplifies the communication and workflow between digital analytics, marketing and engineering departments because of a clearly specificied and strictly typed data model
- puts developers in full control of the code they are running on their (or their clients') website

### What is wrong with existing tagmanagers?
All tagmanagers have one major goal: they take code control away from the developer and grant it to some marketing department or external agency. In most companies the developers are even happy about such a move, because they heavily underestimate the potential negative impact on their product:

- "blackboxed" third party code can be silently deployed into production environments
- many tagmanagers entirely lack any Q/A or review process
- many tagmanagers still need to be integrated synchronously (or at least in the pages' head), causing a major chance of performance drawbacks or critical errors
- a very hard vendor lock-in because almost all bigger companies have their own tag management software, as there is no consistency or standard among these systems

### But my 3rd party vendor told me that ...
Face the ugly truth: third party vendors have a high interest to get you locked into their ecosystem and their dedicated tag management software. Once you have their system integrated it is easy to sell you the next product which then is just "one click away". Of course they don't tell you horror stories about junior developers in some random agency blindly hacking around in production code of multi-million-dollar websites.
